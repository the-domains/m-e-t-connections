The reason I wanted to start my own travel/meeting business is because I am hoping to bring back the personal touch. It seems that has been forgotten with the internet craze. 

Are you planning a trip for Spring break, summer vacation or a family reunion? If you own a small to mid-size company what about considering awarding your employees with an incentive trip? 

Meetings and travel can be challenging without a planner. I can research hotels, go to contract and help execute the meeting for little to no cost.

Give me a chance to show you my personal touch.
